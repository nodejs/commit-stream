## API

**`commitStream([defaultGithubUser, defaultGithubProject])`**

Returns an object stream that you can pipe a stream of newlines from the output of `git log` to. The output of the stream is a series of objects, each representing a commit from the log.`

Intended to be used on a standard log format (not a simplified one using one of the simplifying `--format` options) but it will also process change stats if you `git log --stat`.

Typical usage:

```js
import { spawn } from 'node:child_process'
import split2 from 'split2'
import listStream from 'list-stream'

spawn('bash', ['-c', 'git log'])
  .stdout.pipe(split2()) // break up by newline characters
  .pipe(commitStream('rvagg', 'commit-stream'))
  .pipe(listStream.obj(onCommitList))

function onCommitList (err, list) {
  // list is an array of objects
}
```

Commit object properties:

- `sha`: the full commit sha
- `author`: an object representing the author of the commit
  - `name`: the name of the committer
  - `email`: the email of the committer
- `authors`: a list of such objects representing the authors of the commit, supporting multiple authors through `Co-authored-by:`
- `authorDate`: a string representing the date of the original commit by the author (never change)
- `commitDate`: a string representing the date of the last change of the commit
- `summary`: the one-line summary of the commit
- `description`: the free-form text content of the summary, minus specific metadata lines
- `reviewers`: an array containing objects with `name` and `email` properties if the commit metadata contains reviewers in a `Reviewed-By: Foo Bar <baz@boom>` format.
- `changes`: if `--stat` data is included in the git log, an object containing change stats:
  - `files`: the number of files changed
  - `insertions`: the number of new lines inserted
  - `deletions`: the number of old lines removed
- `prUrl`: a URL pointing to a pull-request where this change was made if the commit metadata contains a `PR-URL: https://github.com/user/project/pull/XX` line. Note that whatever proceeds the `PR-URL: ` string will be collected in this property; one exception being that if a shortened `#XX` version is found and you have supplied `defaultGitHubUser` and `defaultGitHubProject` arguments to the constructor then a full GitHub pull-request will be reconstituted in its place.
- `ghUser`, `ghProject`, `ghIssue`: if a proper GitHub pull request is found for the `prUrl` property (including shortened `#XX` ones), these properties will be added to point to the original user, project and issue (pull-request) for this change, as extracted from the URL. Also, if a commit message line ends with ` (#XX)` as is done with green-button merges, this will be used.
